# Open Portfolio Page

A simple forkable GitHub Pages Portfolio for Engineering & CompSci students (or anyone interested) who are looking to quickly generate a portfolio without learning Web Design

## Purpose

Many college students could greatly benefit from having an online portfolio to track their progress on career development, but lack the skills or time to create a custom website of their own. This project aims to generate a fully working website that only requires the adding of documenting photos, and the adjustment of basic text files in order to customize the content displayed on their website.

Much more will be added overtime, please let me know if you have any suggestions
